# Personal project using React, TypeScript and Material-UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Interactive Avatar
In this project I've experimented with vector graphics, making a navbar with a vector logo of my son's favourite toy robot and a (to-be) interactive vector image of myself. 

I want to make the website repsonsive with a desktop and a mobile mode using Material-UI.
